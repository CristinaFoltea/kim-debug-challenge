		<h1>Meet Kim Schlesinger</h1>
		<h3><p>Hello! My name is Kim, and I grew up in Cañon City, Colorado. Below is a brief timeline about me, and my journey leading to gSchool.</p></h3>
		<p>2008 ➜ I complete my undergraduate degree in music at the University of Northern Colorado, and I teach elementary school music for two years in Fort Collins, Colorado.</p> 
		<p>2010 ➜ I join Teach For America, move to Milwaukee, Wisconsin to attend graduate school, and teach students with emotional/behavioral, and learning disabilities.</p>
		<p>2012 ➜ I move back to Fort Collins, and teach special education for two more years.</p>
		<p>2014 ➜ I attend Bikram Yoga Teacher Training in Khao Lak, Thailand. I return to Colorado, move to Boulder, and become a yoga teacher!</p>
		<p>2015 ➜ I decide to attend gSchool. 
		<h3><p> Practicing yoga, sitting meditation, and spending time with family is very important to me. When I'm not working on gSchool prework, I like hiking, and going up to the Shambhala Mountain Center</p>
